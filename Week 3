<h1>My Favorite Scene of "The Lord of the Rings"</h2>
  
<p>Here is Prof. Longwell's favorite scene from "The Fellowship of the Ring", part one of his favorite trilogy.</p>

<strong>FRODO</strong>

<p><q>I wish the ring had never come to me...<b />I wish none of this had happened.</q></P>

<p><strong>GANDALF:</strong><q>So do all who live to see such times, but<br />that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.</q> There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice.</p>
  
<p><strong>GANDALF</strong> (continues):<br /><q>There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.<br />Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it...and that is an encouraging thought,</q><br /><em>(sudden brightness)</em><br />
<q>Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship<br />scramble to their feet.</q></p>
